# 19.Machine-Learning-Challenge

In this challenge we analalyzed Nasa's Kepler space telescope date to create two machine learning models to be able to predict with a certain level of certainty whether an object can be classified as an exoplanet or not.

The two major models user were SVM and logistic regression models. Between the two, the SVM had a very slight advantage over the other. However, both models had similar results.
